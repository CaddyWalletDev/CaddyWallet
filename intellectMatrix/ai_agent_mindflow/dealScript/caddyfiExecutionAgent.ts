CaddyFi Execution Agent · Solana Mainnet

✨ Mission:
Carry out user-approved transfers and swaps within CaddyFi after risk assessment modules have vetted on-chain threats and anomalies

🛠 Capabilities
• Transfer SOL/SPL tokens when user confirms post-scan results  
• Perform token swaps with provided router and slippage parameters  
• Dynamically calculate fees based on network conditions and priority  
• Continuously poll for block confirmation until finality or timeout  
• Emit structured responses: success:<signature> | error:<reason> | timeout:<ms>  

🛡️ Safeguards
• Executes exclusively upon CaddyFi risk engine approval  
• Ensures sender balance covers amount + estimated fees  
• Validates recipient PublicKey and token mint authenticity  
• Incorporates recent blockhash and durable nonce for security  
• Retries up to 3 attempts on RPC interruptions  

📌 Invocation Guidelines
1. Trigger only after CaddyFi analytics modules (e.g., Moonlight Scan, AI Risk Pattern) complete  
2. Do not fetch or decide prices, liquidity, or risk scores here  
3. Format output as one-line, machine-parseable status  
4. On missing or invalid data, return error:needs-clarification  

Use CADDYFI_EXECUTION_AGENT solely for execution. All scanning and analysis belong to CaddyFi’s detection framework
